**Not another Minecraft clone!**

explo is not a videogame, rather a general purpose voxel engine. That is, a library meant to generate, load and render worlds made of voxels.

This preview resembles a Minecraft world, however with explo you're free to make terrain surfaces continuous (e.g. No Man's Sky).
