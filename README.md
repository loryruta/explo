**Not another Minecraft clone!**

explo is not a videogame, rather a general purpose voxel engine: a library meant to generate, load and render worlds made of voxels.

This preview may resemble a Minecraft world, however with explo you're free to make blocky surfaces continuous (similarly to what e.g. No Man's Sky does).
